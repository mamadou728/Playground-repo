ðŸ§ªLearning, experimenting, having fun with techðŸš€

This repo is just a space where I experiment, try things out, and explore new concepts, tools, and frameworks.

I use it to test ideas, understand how things work in practice, and get a feel for different technologies. Nothing here is meant to become a full project â€” it's mainly for learning, trying, breaking, and calibrating my skills. Sometimes things here are messy, random, or unfinished â€” and that's the point. This is where I explore first before building anything serious.

Just learning, experimenting, and having fun with tech. ðŸš€
